# Simple Python program which can solve 9×9 Sudoku boards using the Backtracking algorithm.

It can solve pretty much any 9×9 board, as long as it's solveable.
It was a fun project.
In the future I will make a randition of Sudoku as a playable version. 
Definitely will incorporate something from this.
